# Temp-St7789
We want to monitor the ambient temperature on a TFT monitor.

## What it DO!
In this tutorial we are going to monitor the ambient temperature on a TFT monitor, but this does not mean that only the temperature value number is displayed on the monitor, thanks to TFT monitors we have access to all the required colors and we will also be able to We had to display different shapes. In this tutorial, we will use the LM35 sensor to obtain temperature values, which is one of the most accurate and affordable sensors to buy.


### Items needed
-TFT LCD St7789
-LM35
-ESP8266

### Required libraries
-Arduino_ST7789
-SPI

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we will display the ambient temperature by drawing the shape of a thermometer on the screen and also by defining an animation for it. In this tutorial, the Nodemcu board based on the ESP8266 chip will be used as the driver board. We will also use the LM35 sensor to measure the temperature. The LM35 temperature sensor is one of the most widely used and suitable for measuring ambient temperature.
